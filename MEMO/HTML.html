HTML

BASICS:
    The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration should always be the first line of code in your HTML files.
    The <html> element will contain all of your HTML code.
    Information about the web page, like the title, belongs within the <head> of the page.
    You can add a title to your web page by using the <title> element, inside of the head.
    Code for visible HTML content will be placed inside of the <body> element.

CODE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
    <title>Mon petit programme HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

COMMON ELEMENTS:

    You can add headings of different sizes using the different headings elements: <h1> through <h6>.
    Paragraphs are added with the <p> element.
    Unordered lists are created with the <ul> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
    Ordered lists are created with the <ol> element and list items are added using the <li> element.
    You can add links to your web page using the <a> element - don't forget the href attribute!
    Images can be added with the <img> element - don't forget the src attribute!
    Images help support visually impaired users when <img> elements include the alt attribute.
    You can turn anything into a link by wrapping it with an <a> element.
    White space in the HTML file does not affect the positioning of elements in the browser.
    The W3C recommends 2 spaces of indentation for nested HTML elements.
    Comments are used to take notes inside of an HTML file. You can add a comment with <!-- This is a comment -->.
